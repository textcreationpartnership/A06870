            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE beſt learned, and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Phyloſophers, hauing recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued no taſte or light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, but only being led and directed by Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, helde this for a Principle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues, that MAN was not borne to himſelfe onely, but was framed of Nature ſuch an excellent Creature as he is, to that ende, that he myght employ thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular gifts wherewith he is beautifyed, as Wiſedome, Reaſon, Memorie, Diſcretion, and Iudgement, not onely to his owne priuate commoditie, but alſo to the profite of his Countrie, and others. This good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ingraffed in their myndes by Nature, deliuered from one to another by Inſtruction, and ſo from time to time continued among themſelues by conſent: cauſed the beſt able men among them, ſuch as God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had plentifully endued with knowledge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to leaue ſuch worthy Monuments as they did to Poſteritie: as Plato, and Tullie, good Rules of lyfe and gouernement. Ariſtotle, the hidden ſecretes of Philoſophye: Ptolomie, the hie my ſteries of Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: Euclyde, the infallible Principles of Geometrie. Varro, the neceſſarie obſeruations of Huſbandrye. &amp;c. Out of the whiche, ſo great commodities in all ages haue bene reaped, and (as occaſion and good wittes haue ſerued) haue alſo from time to time bene encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. If this Principle of theirs be ſounde and true (as in deede I take it to be) then of conſequence, one other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon the ſame, muſt needes bee as true, and <pb facs="tcp:12283:6"/> that is this: That thoſe men doe neareſt approch to the Rule of vncorrupt Nature, and do beſt deſerue of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welth, whoſe labours and traueyles are beſtowed on thoſe thinges which tende to the beſt ende. For by the conſideration of the ende wherevnto eche thing lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: the goodneſſe and excellencye of the thing it ſelfe is to be knowne and eſteemed. As for example: If helth eyther maintayned, or recouered bee good: then Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, whoſe chiefe ende is to maintayne and recouer health, muſt needes be good alſo. If good gouernement publikelye, and peaceable enioying of our owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, be a good thing, and to be commended: then the Law, for that it reſpecteth Iuſtice in all actions, and quietneſſe, as his chiefe ende, muſt needes likewyſe be good, and deſerue the like commendation. And as be many things, which for this ſelfe ſame Reaſon that I haue nowe alleaged, are to bee accounted good, and prayſe worthy in their kynde: So, I thinke there is no man ſo farre from Reaſon, but that hee ſeeth, by the ſelfe ſame Argument it muſt needes bee inforced, that though many Artes and ſciences be good, for that their endes be good: yet ſome one there is, that is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as beſt, for that his ende is beſt. The chiefe ende of Man in this worlde, what it is, I thynke no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man ſo ſlenderlye inſtructed, that hee maketh anye doubt therof. For the very Philoſophers themſelues, of whome I ſpake before, were fully reſolued, that it was to liue well and vertuouſly, and affirmed, that (wheras other Creatures are made grooueling, and ſtill behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the grounde as they go) Man was therfore framed ſtreyght and vpright, that hee might alwayes beholde Heauen and heauenly things, and ſo by the very ſhape <pb facs="tcp:12283:6"/> of his bodye and countenance, be put in mynde conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, that albeit hee were here for a ſeaſon, as a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Pylgrime vpon earth, yet his end was, to be a free Citizen, and an inheritor of heauen aboue: And as they by Reaſon and Coniecture were ledde ſo to thinke: ſo we by fayth, and expreſſe commaundement, are moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſo ſtedfaſtly to beleeue. If then the knowledge of God and heauenly things, be the chiefeſt end and mark whereat man ought to ſhoote, it muſt nedes be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that thoſe mens ſtudyes and labours deſerue the greateſt prayſe, which are employed to the attayning and directing of others therevnto. Wherein, as God in all ages hath alwayes ſtirred vp ſome, who haue taken great paynes therein, to the publike commoditie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: So, in my ſimple iudgement, neyther this preſent worke, neyther the Author thereof deſerueth the leaſt commendation. And albeit I wote full vvell, that ſo the worke it ſelfe be good, it is not greatly materiall what the workeman be: yet, like as good Wyne is then beſt, vvhen it is drunke out of a cleane veſſell, and good meat then beſt delighteth, when the dreſſer therof is cleanly: So this Booke, which of it ſelfe, I doubt not, to be ſuch, that it will be liked of all thoſe who delight in God and godlyneſſe, I truſt, euen for the Authors ſake, it ſhall neuer awhit the woorſe be welcome. Of vvhoſe ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere lyfe, and great prayſes, although there is good cauſe why I ſhoulde ſpeake, for that hee hath bene of long time throughly knowne to me, and I am aſſured his vertues and integritie to bee ſuch, that if I ſhoulde ſaye, there are fevve his like to bee founde, I truſt, for ſaying the truth, no good man woulde be offended: Yet partly for that I am not ignorant, that no man deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <pb facs="tcp:12283:7"/> leſſe to heare his owne praiſe than he doth: partly for that there be many cauſes why I ſhould rather ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, than for lacke of ſufficient skill and abilitie, meanelye prayſe him: I will leaue him to thy particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar iudgement (gentle Reader) and to the teſtimoniall of the vvhole vvorld, vvho I doubt not, vvill ſay no leſſe, but that he is a man vvithout fraude or guile, and ſuch one as feareth God.</p>
            <p>As touching the Booke it ſelfe, good reaſon it is, ech man ſhoulde vſe his ovvne iudgement and opinion. But if my ſimple Teſtimoniall maye preuayle, I dare vvarrant it to bee ſuch, that vvhat ſtudie ſoeuer thou ſhalt beſtovve in reading the ſame, it ſhall vvell requite thy paynes. And though the Author be ſuch, that he rather delighteth in good and vertuous lyfe, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth boſte of anye great learning: Yet ſuch hath his paynes bene herein, that very good Clarkes neede take no ſcorne, to receiue ſome light from this his Candell. In ſumme: the Booke is of God, and his holy Saintes, and therefore to be reuerenced: collected out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore no vaine fable: written briefely, and therefore not tedious: ſet forth in playne and ſimple vvyſe, and therefore the better for thy capacitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> truely reporting the lyfe and death of ſuch, as eyther for ſinne, (and thoſe to be auoyded) eyther for vertue, (and thoſe to bee imitated) haue mention made in Gods holye Booke. All that is vvritten therein, is vvritten for thy helpe and inſtruction. Vſe it then to that ende that the Authour meaneth, that is: Not onely to increaſe thy knovvledge, and ſo to be made more learned: but alſo to increaſe thy vertuous life, and ſo to become the better Man.</p>

He tooke Eliſaba the daughter of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab of the Tribe of Iuda, to wyfe. He was the fyrſt Byſhop of the Iewes. And left (with Hur) to gouerne the<note place="margin">24. d.</note> people in the abſence of Moſes, while he was in the Mount wyth God. And in the meane time the people (beyng yet<note place="margin">32. cap.</note> infected wyth the ydolatrie of Egipt) cryed out againſt Aaron to make them goddes to go before them. Then Aaron (perceyuing the people inclyned to ydolatrie, and alſo thinking they woulde rather forgoe the ſame, than to forſake their precious Iewels) ſayde vnto them: Plucke of the golden earerings in the eares of your Wyues, your ſonnes, and of your daughters, and bring them to mée. The people did ſo, &amp; Aaron made thereof a Calfe. Which when the people ſawe and behelde, they were excéeding gladde. And began now to worſhip and honor the Calfe as a godde, hopping and daunceyng for ioye. But the Lorde aboue, beholding theyr wickedneſſe, tolde it to Moſes, and ſent him downe poſt haſte to refourme their wycked at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes. Who then comming downe from the Mount wyth the Tables of God in hys hande, and drawyng néere to the hoſt, hée ſawe the Calfe, and the people daunceyng before it. Which ſight, ſo kindeled the wrath of Moſes, &amp; grieued hys heart ſo ſore, that he threwe the Tables oute of his handes, tooke the Calfe and burnt it in the fyer, and <pb n="2" facs="tcp:12283:8"/> ſtampte it all into powder and aſhes, which he threwe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water, and forced the people to drinke it. Then he demaunded of Aaron, what the people did to him, that he had brought ſo great a ſinne vpon them. Aaron ſayde: let not the wrath of my Lorde ware fierce, thou knoweſt the people that they are ſet on miſchiefe. For they ſayde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mée, make vs goddes to go before vs, for we wote not what is become of Moſes, the man that brought vs out of Egipt. Then I required to haue their golde and Iewels, which they brought vnto mée, and I did caſt them into the fier, and thereof came out this Calfe. Moſes then vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding<note place="margin">Idolatrie puniſhed.</note> the matter, commaunded the children of Leui to fall vpon the ydolaters, and ſlue of them about thrée thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande<note place="margin">Nu. 12. cap.</note> perſons. After this, it came to paſſe that Aaron and Miriam his ſiſter, did grudge againſt their brother Moſes bicauſe he had taken an Ethiopian to wyfe, ſaying on this wyſe: hath the Lorde in déede ſpoken onely through Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? and hath he not ſpoken alſo by vs? The Lorde not<note place="margin">Diſobedience puniſhed.</note> content wyth this their contemning of Moſes auctoritie, was ſore diſpleaſed, and ſtroke Miriam wyth a foule le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie. Which ſo much diſcomforted Aaron, to ſée his ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo fowlye arayed and diſfigured, that he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to Moſes, and ſayde: Alas my Lorde, I beſéech thée put not the ſinne vppon vs, which we haue fooliſhlye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted &amp; ſinned. Oh, let hir not be as one deade, of whom the fleſhe is halfe conſumed, when he commeth out of hys mothers wombe.

And nowe being paſſed the redde Sea, they came to the wilderneſſe of Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay, where the waters being bitter, he made them ſwéete, and fedde them forty yeares with meate from heauen.

                  <label>Berieſus,</label> (which by interpretacion is as much to ſaye, as the ſonne of Ieſus) was a Iewe borne, and a great ſorcerer, which name he had taken vpon him, to deceyue the people, where as his right name was Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, which worde in the Sirians language, betokeneth an Enchaunter, and a falſe Prophet alſo. This falſe Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer was got into the Citie of Paphos, and there beyng crept into fauour with Sergius Paulus, Ruler of the Countrie, wythſtoode the doctrine of Barnabas and Paule, ſéeking by all meanes to turne the Rulers heart from the ſayth in Chriſt. But Paule (being full of the holy ghoſt) perceyuing the deuiliſhe and ſubtile craft of this ſorcerer, looked ſtedfaſtly vpon him and ſayde: O full of all ſubtiltie and miſchiefe, the chylde of the Deuil, and enimie of all righteouſneſſe, wylt thou not ceaſe to peruert the ſtreyght wayes of the Lorde: Now therfore beholde, the hande of the Lorde is vpon thée, and thou ſhalt be blinde, and not able to ſée the Sunne for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And when Paule had pronounced theſe wordes, the Enchaunter was ſtricken with blyndeneſſe, ſo that he (as one amazed) wandred vp and downe, ſéeking for ſome man to leade him by the hande.

In the which prayer as he was (on a time) occupyed aboute the ninth houre of the day (which was a little before Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tyme) he ſaw in a viſion an Angell of God comming to him, and calling him by his name, ſaying: Cornelius, thy prayers and thine Almes déedes are come vp into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce before God, wherefore ſende to Ioppa for one Symon whoſe Sirname is Peter, he lodgeth with one Simon a Tanner, whoſe houſe ioyneth vpon the Sea ſide, and he ſhall tell thée what thou oughteſt to doe.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:12283:49"/> when Peter was come, Cornelius mette him and fell downe at his féete to worſhip hym, which thing Peter would not ſuffer, foraſmuch as he was but a man as Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius was.

Therfore came I vnto you without ſaying nay, aſſoone as I was ſent for. I aſke therefore, for what intent haue yée ſent for me? Then Cornelius ſayd: Foure dayes ago, and euen about this ſame houre I faſted, and at the ninth houre I prayed in my houſe, and behold, a man ſtoode before me in bright clothing and ſayde: Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine Almes déeds are had in remembraunce in the ſight of God, ſende therefore to Ioppa, and call for Symon whoſe Sirname is Peter, he is lodged in the houſe of one Symon a Tanner by the Sea ſide, the which, aſſoone as he is come ſhall ſpeake vnto thée. Then ſent I for thée immediately, and thou haſt well done for to come: Now therefore are we all here preſent before God, to heare all thinges that are commaunded vnto thée. Then Peter preached the worde of God vnto them, and whyle he was yet preaching, the holy Ghoſt fell vpon them all, ſo that in the ende, Cornelius with all his Company there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, were Baptized in the name of Chriſt Ieſu.

After this, Daniel expounded the Kinges dreames, and ſhewed him the true interpretacion and meaning thereof (which none of the Chaldeans coulde doe) for the which the King rewarded him wyth great gyftes, and made him gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ouer the whole Prouince of Babilon, wherewyth, the other Princes and Rulers were ſore offended, and ſought occaſion againſt him concerning the kingdome, but Daniel was ſo faythfull and vpright in all the Kings matters, that they confeſſed, and ſayde: We ſhall fynde no occaſion againſt this Daniel, except it be concerning the lawe of his God: Therefore let vs perſwade the king to make a decrée, that whoſoeuer ſhall aſke a peticion of any god or man for thirtie dayes, ſaue only of the King, the ſame to be caſt into the denne of Lyons. And when the King had conſented to this wicked decrée, and ſealed the wryting, Daniel (that all men might ſée, that he woulde neyther conſent in heart nor déede for theſe fewe dayes, to anye thing that was contrarye to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye) <pb n="81" facs="tcp:12283:52"/> went home to his houſe, and ſet open the wyndowe of his Chamber towarde Ierusalem, and fell downe vppon hys knées to gyue thanckes and prayſe vnto God, as hys cuſtome was thrée tymes a daye to doe. And thus making his prayers and ſupplication to his God, his aduerſaries came vpon him and founde hym a worke wherevpon they went to the king and ſayde: haſt thou not ſealed the decrée, that whoſoeuer ſhall make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to any God or man within thirtie daies ſaue to thée (O King) ſhalbe caſt into the denne of Lions. True it is quoth the king, and it cannot be broken. Then ſayd they: This Daniel one of thy priſoners of Iuda, regardeth neyther thée nor yet thy ſtatute, but maketh his peticion thriſe a day vnto his god. When the King heard this, he was ſore diſpleaſed in himſelfe, and ſought by all meanes to haue excuſed Daniel, and when he ſawe no intreatie woulde ſerue, nor no way be founde to alter the lawe, he ſuffred Daniel to be caſt down to the Lions, which were ſeuen in numbre, and were kept faſting that daye from their ordinarie dyet, to the intent they ſhoulde haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured Daniel: But God had ſo ſtopped the mouthes and furie of the Lyons, that they dyd him no harme, and leaſt he ſhould periſh there for hunger, God ſent his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Abacucke with meate and drinke to féede hym, and alſo mooued the kings heart to take ſuch care for Daniel, that the ſeuenth day after, he went to the denne to ſée if he were a lyue or dead, and finding hym not periſhed, but whole and ſounde, he reioyced greatly, and cauſed Daniel to be taken out, &amp; his accuſers with their wyues and children caſt downe among the fierce gréedy Lions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, who tore them all in péeces before they came at the grounde.

Then they that had the charge of the Kings wicked acte, for the olde friendſhip of the man, tooke him aſide priuilye, and prayed him that he woulde take ſuch fleſhe as was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to eate, and diſſemble as though he had eaten euen of the things appointed by the King, euen the fleſhe of the ſacrifice, that in ſo dooing, he might be deliuered from death, and that for the olde friendſhip that was among them, he woulde receyue this fauour.

And ſo thorowe mine hypocriſie (for a little time of a tranſitorie life) they might be deceyued by me, and I ſhoulde procure male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and reproch to mine olde age. For though I were nowe deliuered from the torments of men, yet coulde I not eſcape the hande of the Almightie, neyther aliue nor dead. Wherfore I will now chaunge this lyfe manfully, and will ſhewe my ſelfe ſuch as mine age requireth. And ſo will leaue a notable example for ſuch as be yong, to die willingly &amp; couragiouſly, for the honorable &amp; holy lawes:

And when he had brought Paul forth before his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, &amp; heard his accuſation made by one Tartullus an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, Felix beckened to Paul, that he ſhould anſwere for himſelfe, &amp; when he had heard Pauls anſwere, he deferred the examination of the matter vntill another time, ſaying <pb n="114" facs="tcp:12283:72"/> vnto Paules aduerſaries, that for as much as Liſias the hye Captaine did knowe the whole matter as it ſtoode, he woulde at his comming, heare them further.

It was not long after this, or that Felix (being returned to Ceſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea againe with his wyfe Drucilla a Iewe borne) called forth Paule, being deſirous to haue further knowledge of him as concerning the ſect that he profeſſed.

This corrupt Magiſtrate gaped for brybes and rewards to looſe Paul, and therefore called him the oftener, thinking that Paule woulde haue giuen him a péece of money to be deliuered, but when he ſawe that none woulde come, and Portus Feſtus was ſent from Nero the Emperour to ſuccéede hym in his roome, then willing rather to ſhew the Iewes a pleaſure, than to deliuer Paule, left hym in priſon bounde.

                  <label>Feſtus,</label> Portius (by Nero the Emperour) was made Preſident in the roume of Felix. Which Feſtus within thrée dayes he came to his Prouince, aſcended from Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea to Ieruſalem, where the hye Prieſtes and Elders of the Iewes, enformed him of Paule, deſiring his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour againſt him, and that he would ſende for him to haue the matter pleaded there. Whoſe requeſt if Feſtus had graunted, they were fully bent to haue ſlayne Paule in the way comming to Ieruſalem: But Feſtus made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that the priſoner ſhoulde remayne at Ceſarea vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his comming, whither (ſayde he) I entende ſhortly to <pb n="115" facs="tcp:12283:72"/> repayre, and if there be any among you that is able to accuſe him, let them go downe with me, and they ſhall be hearde. And ſo when Feſtus was come to Ceſarea, the next day after he ſate in iudgement vpon Paule. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whome the Iewes layde many ſore matters to his charge, which they were not able to prooue, ſo long as Paule aunſwered for himſelfe. Then Feſtus (willing to doe the Iewes a pleaſure) ſayde vnto Paule: wylt thou go vp to Ieruſalem, and there be iudged of theſe thinges before me. Then ſayde Paule: I ſée no cauſe wherefore I ſhoulde go thither, but may be iudged as well here as there. But foraſmuch as the Iewes ſéeketh my condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt all right and Iuſtice, I appeale to the Emperour. Well (ſayde Feſtus) thou haſt appealed to the Emperour, and to him ſhalt thou go. Within a fewe dayes after this, it chaunced King Agrippa with Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice his wyfe, to come vnto Ceſarea to ſalute and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Feſtus the newe Preſident. And during the Kings aboade there, Feſtus (by occaſion) rehearſed Paules matter vnto him, ſaying: Felix my predeceſſor left here a certaine man in holde, whome the hye Prieſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Iewes at Ieruſalem, complained on, deſiring mée for their ſakes to giue ſentence agaynſt him. To whom I anſwered, that it was not the cuſtome of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, to giue ſentence againſt any man, before his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers were brought before him, that he might make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for himſelfe. And ſo when his accuſers were come hither, I on the next day ſate in iudgement, &amp; commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the priſoner to be brought forth before me, againſt whom, his accuſers brought no accuſation of ſuch things as I ſuppoſed they would haue done, but demaunded cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne queſtions of him concerning their owne ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and laying to his charge one Ieſus which was deade, whome he affirmed to be riſen from death to lyfe againe. And foraſmuch as I wilt not wel what to ſay in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I aſked him whether he would go to Ieruſalem, and <pb n="116" facs="tcp:12283:73"/> there to be iudged. And when he had refuſed that, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to Ceſar, I commaunded him to be kept in priſon, vntill I might haue occaſion to ſende him to Ceſar. Then ſayde the King to Feſtus: I haue hearde much of that ſame Ieſus and his Diſciples, and therefore am much deſirous to heare the fellow ſpeake my ſelfe, before he go to Ceſar. Whervpon, Feſtus on the next morow brought forth Paule into the Common hall before Agrippa the King, ſaying on this wyſe: King Agrippa, and you all that be here preſent, ye ſée this man, whom all the Iewes haue complayned on to me, both at Ieruſalem and here, crying that he ought not to liue any longer, and yet haue I made inquirie, and can finde nothing worthy of death that he hath committed: neuertheleſſe, for as much as he hath appealed to the Emperour, I am determined to ſende him thither, and yet bicauſe I haue no certayne thing to wryte vnto his Maieſtie, I haue brought hym forth before you, and ſpecially to the King Agrippa, that after examination had, I might haue ſomewhat to write, for me thinke it ſtandeth with no reaſon, to ſende a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and not to ſhew withall what is layde to his charge.

Then began Paule to ſpeake, and made ſuch a pithy declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his former lyfe, and of hys calling to Chriſt, that Feſtus (which was not ſkilfull in the Iewes religion) thought all his ſayings to be but madneſſe, and cryed out with a lowde voyce, ſaying that he was beſide himſelfe, and that much learning had made him madde.

And for to be the better confirmed in his vocation, hée tooke a fléece of wooll, and layde it in the threſhing place, and made his requeſt vnto God, ſaying: Oh Lorde, if thou wilt let the dewe (this night) fall vpon the fléece only, and be drie on all the grounde beſide, then ſhall I be ſure that thou wilt ſaue Iſrael by my handes, as thou haſt ſayde: And on the morrowe when Gedeon came to <pb n="123" facs="tcp:12283:77"/> take vp the fléece, it was full of dewe, and the grounde drie all about.

And when the Prince ſawe the Prophetes ſeruant come running ſo faſt after him, he (for the reuerence he bare to his Maiſter) deſcended from his Charret to méete him, and aſked of him if all were well with his Maiſter or no. Yea (ſayde Gehezi) all is well: But euen nowe there is come to my Maiſter from Mount Ephraim, twoo yoong men of the ſonnes of the Prophets, wherefore he hath ſent me, to deſire thée to let him haue one Talent of Siluer, and twoo chaunge of garments. Then the Prince (of his liberalitie) gaue him twoo Talents, and made his men to carie the money and ſtuffe after Gehezi.

And as ſoone as Gehezi came in the preſence of his Maiſter, he demaunded where he had bene. No where, quoth he. No (ſaid Eliſeus) went not my hart with thée when the man turned againe from his Charret to méete thée? Is it now a time to receiue money or garments? Well, foraſmuch as thou haſt offended in this, the leproſie of Naaman ſhal eleaue vnto thée, and to thy ſéede for euer. And ſo he went out from his Maiſter a Leper as whyte as ſnowe.

They choſe out certaine men among them to ſende as ambaſſadours to Ioſua, and made their prouiſion of breade dryed vp and hored: And put their wyne into olde bottels all to rent and torne: and ſhodde themſelues with olde clouted ſhooen: and put on their backes olde garments, and ſo ſent them forth to Ioſua to obtayne peace. And when Ioſua looked vppon them, and behelde their ſimple ſtate: he aſked what they were, and from whence they came: They aunſwered, from a farre countrey are thy ſeruauntes come for the name of the Lorde thy God: for we haue hearde of hys fame and power, and what he did in the lande of Egypt, and in all other places till nowe.

His helmet vpon his heade was of braſſe, and the Bootes on his legges of the ſame. His coate of Fence weyed 5000. ſicles. The ſhaft of his Speare which he bare in his hande was lyke a Weauers beame. And the heade vpon the ſame weighed. 600. ſicles of yron. This man beyng thus armed, came out from the Philiſtines (one bearing his ſhielde before him) and ſtanding betwéene the twoo hoſtes in a valley, he cryed to the hoſte of Iſrael, ſaying: Why are ye come to ſet your battell in aray? am not I a Philiſtine, and you the ſeruauntes of Saule? chooſe you out a man, and let him come downe to me. And if he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your ſeruants: and if I can ouercome him, and kill him, then ſhall ye be our ſeruants, and ſerue vs. Thus came he day by day defying the whole hoſte of Iſrael, the ſpace of fortie dayes long, wherewith the Iſraelites were ſore afrayde and diſcomſited, and durſt not abyde his ſight. But God (who by his ſecret prouidence had appoynted out a man to match him) cauſed Iſai to ſend his yong ſon Dauid to the hoſte of Iſrael to ſée his brethren howe they did. And as he ſtoode with them, and hearde the deſpyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <pb n="129" facs="tcp:12283:80"/> wordes of Golias which he ſpake againſt the holye hoſte of Iſrael: The ſpirit of God (euen at that inſtant) ſmote ſuch a courage into the hart of Dauid, that he ſlipt away from his brethren vnto the people (whome he ſawe in great feare) and ſayde: What ſhall be done to the man that killeth this Philiſtine, and taketh away the ſhame from Iſrael? and what is this vncircumciſed heathen, that he ſhoulde thus reuyle the hoſte of the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God. Dauid vttering this bolde maner of ſpeach once or twyſe, he was (at the laſt) brought before King Saule, to whome he ſayde on this wyſe: Oh King, let no mans heart fayle him, or be afrayde this daye, for I thy ſeruaunt will go and fight with yonder Philiſtine. Thou art not able to ſtande in his handes (quoth the King) for he is a man brought vp all the dayes of his lyfe in feates of warre, and thou art yet but a chylde, without experience or knowledge thereof. Then Dauid to ſtrengthen the weake fayth of the King, ſayde thus vnto him: As thy ſeruaunt was kéeping his fathers ſhéepe, there came a Lion and a Beare likewyſe, and tooke a ſhéepe out of the flocke. Then I (not fearing the force of theſe twoo cruell beaſtes) ranne out, firſt after the Lion, and tooke the pray out of his mouth, and in ſpite of his bearde I ſlue him. Likewyſe I ſerued the Beare. Wherefore I haue no doubt, but as the Lorde did ayde me then, ſo wyll he nowe againſt this bragging Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, that hath ſo rayled on the hoſte of the liuing God. Then Saule (perceyuing the power of God to be wyth Dauid) put his armour vpon him. But Dauid (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woont to ſuch) put it of agayne, and tooke him to his olde accuſtomed weapon, which was his ſlyng. And ſo, hauing that in his hande, and his ſhepeherdes bagge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, with a fewe little ſtones prouided therin, he gat him downe to the place where the Philiſtine ſtoode wayting for a man to encounter with him. And as he ſaw Dauid drawe neare, and beholding the maner of hys <pb n="130" facs="tcp:12283:81"/> weapon that he bare in his hand, he diſdained him great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And curſing Dauid by all his gods, he ſayd in a great furie: Am I a Dogge, that thou commeſt to me wyth ſtaues, come hyther my chylde, and I will giue thy fleſh to the foules of the ayre, and beaſtes of the fielde. Nay (quoth Dauid) thou commeſt to me with ſworde, ſpeare, and ſhielde, but I am come vnto thée, in the name of the Lorde of hoſtes, the God of the hoſte of Iſrael, whome thou doeſt deſpyſe and blaſpheme. He ſhall this daye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer thée into my handes, and I ſhall ſmyte thée, and take thy heade from thée, and giue the carkaſſes of all your hoſte to the foules of the ayre, and beaſts of the field to deuour and eate, that thou, and all the worlde maye knowe, that there is a God in Iſrael. The Philiſtyne nowe was in ſuch a chafe, that he began to buſkell hym to his weapon, thinking to haue diſpatched Dauid wyth no great adoe. But Dauid hauing his ſlyng prepared re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his hande, ſlang out the ſtone at his face (the Lord directing the ſame) and ſmote the Philiſtine ſo euen, and déepe in his foreheade, that he fell downe groueling vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the earth, and then ranne Dauid and ſmote of hys heade. Thus was this monſtrous Gyaunt confounded, and all the hoſte of the Philiſtines put to flight and ſlaine.

But whyle the writings were a making, and poſtes ſent into all quarters for the Iewes diſpatch, Mardocheus gat knowledge of all Hamans wicked intents and purpoſes, and founde the meanes to haue the ſame vttered vnto Quéene Heſter.

But yet all this doth not ſatiſfie mée, ſo long as I ſée Mardocheus the Iewe ſitting at the Kings gate.

Then Haman thinking the King had gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to honour none but hym, ſayde: Let the man whom the King intendeth to bring to honour, be arayned in ſuch Royall apparell as the King vſeth to weare, and ſet vpon the Kinges horſe with the Crowne Imperiall vpon his heade, and commaunde one of the Kings Princes to cary him about the ſtreates of the Citie with a proclamacion before him, ſaying: Thus ſhall it be done to the man, whome the King pleaſeth to bring to honour. Then ſayde the King: take the rayment and the horſe, and go thou to Mardocheus the Iewe which ſitteth at my gate, and fayle not to doe vnto him, all that thou haſt ſayde. Then went Haman about the Kinges commaundement, and performed all thinges according to his minde, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, he gat him home with an heauye heart, to his wyfe and friends, declaring vnto them what things had happened vnto him.

Then when Abſalom had retayned Huſai to be of his Counſell, he ſayde vnto him: Achitophell hath coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled thus and thus to doe, ſhall we doe thereafter or no. Huſai anſwered, the Counſell that Achitophell hath giuen, is not good at this time. For (ſayd he) thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy father and his men, howe they be ſtrong, and now being chafed in their myndes, are euen as a Beare rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of hir Whelpes in the fielde. And alſo thy father is a man practiſed in warre: and maketh no tarying wyth the people. Beholde he lurketh nowe in ſome Caue, or in ſome other ſtrong place, and though ſome of his men be ouerthrowen at the firſt brunt, it will be ſayde that thy people is ouerthrowen, and ſo ſhall the beſt men thou haſt (whoſe hearts are as the hearts of Lyons) ſhrynke thereat. For all Iſrael knoweth thy father to be a man of great might, and his warriours ſtoute men. Therefore my counſell is, that all Iſrael be gathered togither vnto thée, from Dan to Béerſeba (which are in number as the ſande of the ſea.) And that thou go to battell in thyne owne perſon. For ſo ſhall we come vpon him in one place or other, where we ſhall finde him, and fall vpon hym as thicke as the dewe falleth vpon the grounde, and of all the men that are with him, we ſhall not leaue him one. Moreouer, if he be gotten into a towne, then ſhall all the men of Iſraell bring roapes to that towne or Citie, &amp; we will drawe it into the riuer, vntill there be not one ſtone founde there.

But when the daye of Mariage came, Lea the elder was put in hir ſteade, for ſo much as it was not the cuſtome, that the yonger ſhoulde be firſt married (as Laban alleaged.)

And alſo if the King woulde licence him, to ſet vp a place for exerciſe, &amp; a place for the youth, and to name them of Ieruſalem Antiochians: he promiſed an hundred and fiftie Talents. And when theſe things was graunted to Iaſon, and that he had got the ſuperioritie: he beganne immediately to drawe his kinſmen to the cuſtomes of the heathen, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the lawes and priuiledges of the Iewes, he brought in newe ſtatutes, contrary to the lawe of God.

And ſo he went with the Elders, who brought him to Mizpa, and being there made and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their heade and Ruler, he ſent his meſſengers to the King of Ammon, demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding what cauſe he had to ſtriue with Iſrael: who anſwered, and ſayde: Bicauſe they tooke away my countrie, when they came from Egypt, which if they will now reſtore agayne, I will ceaſe from

And before his going, made this vowe vnto the Lorde: That if he did deliuer the Ammonites into his hande, the firſt thing that met him out of his doores at his returne home againe, ſhoulde be the Lordes, and he woulde offer it vp vnto him for a burnt offering. And when he had ſubdued the Ammonites, and was comming homewarde to hys houſe, the firſt thing that met him out at his doores, was his owne daughter, who for ioye of hir fathers victorie, came againſt him with Timbrels and daunces. Then Iephtah ſéeing his onely chylde come agaynſt him with a companie of women after hir, he rent his clothes and ſayde: Alas my daughter, thou haſt brought me lowe, and art one of them that doe trouble mée, for I haue ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my mouth vnto the Lorde, and cannot go backe.

And being on the ſea, a tempeſt roſe ſo vehemently, that the Mariners were ſore afrayde, crying euery man vnto his God, and to lighten the ſhippe, they caſt all the wares into the Sea, which nothing auayled. Then went the maiſter of the ſhip downe vnder the hatches, and finding Ionas faſt a ſléepe, awoke him, ſaying: O thou ſléeper, what meaneſt thou, ariſe and call vpon thy God, that we periſhe not. And when no remedy coulde be had, they agréed to caſt lottes, that thereby they might knowe for whoſe cauſe they were troubled, and ſo dooing, the lot fell on Ionas: They ſéeing that, ſayde: Tell vs for whoſe cauſe we are thus troubled? And what thine occupaſion is? And what thou art? And whence thou commeſt, &amp; whither thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt? And what Country man thou art, &amp; of what nation? I am (ſayde Ionas) an Hebrue borne, and feare the Lord God of Heauen, which made both the Sea and drye land, and am fled from his preſence. And when they heard that, they were more afrayde than before, &amp; ſayde: what ſhall we doe vnto thée, that the Sea may ceaſe from troubling of vs? Take me (quoth Ionas) and caſt me into the Sea, and ye ſhall haue reſt, for I wote it is for my ſake, that this euill is come vpon you: Neuertheleſſe, the men (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loth to committe ſuch a déede) aſſayed with rowyng to bring the ſhip to lande.

And ſo they tooke Ionas and caſt him into the Sea, which incontinent was calme and ſtill. And a <pb n="179" facs="tcp:12283:107"/> certayne great fiſhe (prepared of the Lord) receyued Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, and ſwallowed him vp into his body, where he laye (in prayer) thrée dayes and thrée nights.

And when he came to the citie &amp; was entered a dayes iourney in the ſame, he cryed out, ſaying: There are yet fourtie daies, and then ſhall Niniue be ouerthrowne. But when his Prophecie came to none effect, by reaſon of the peoples great repentaunce, he was ſore diſpleaſed, and in his prayer, ſayde: O Lorde, was not this my ſaying (I praye thée when I was yet in my Countrey, and the cauſe of my flying to Tharſus, that thou waſt a mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God, full of compaſſion, long ſuffering, and of great goodneſſe, and wouldeſt repent thée of the euill? And now O Lord, foraſmuch as I am founde falſe in my ſayings, take (I beſéeche thée) my lyfe from mée, for I had rather dye than lyue. And ſo Ionas got him out of the Citie, and made him a booth on the Eaſt ſide thereof. And as he ſate vnder the ſhadow of his booth, to ſée what ſhoulde become of the Citie: the Lord cauſed a wylde Vine to ſpring ouer his heade, to giue him more ſhadowe to defende the heate of the Sunne from him, whereof Ionas was very glad.

Then the King prepared a great refection for the Sirians, and filled their bellyes <pb n="184" facs="tcp:12283:110"/> well, and ſent them home againe, for the which gentle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie of Ioram, the King of Siria neuer troubled hym more.

Take héede and be circumſpect when the Meſſenger commeth, and kéepe him at the dore, for the ſounde of his Maiſters féete is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, which was euen ſo, for the Kinges minde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, he followed the Meſſenger, and came to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet himſelfe, ſaying: This euill is of the Lorde, and what more ſhall I looke for of hym?

                  <label>Ioſeph,</label> the ſonne of Iacob and Rachel, was in hys youth, of his father aboue all other beloued, in ſo much, that he made him a coate of many colours: But his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren hated him, bicauſe his dreames ſignified vnto them, that he ſhould be Lorde ouer them all, and they his ſeruantes. And being at the age of .xvij. yeares, he was ſent to them with victualles, where they laye with their ſhéepe at Dothan, who ſeeing him come a farre of, began to deryde and mocke him, ſaying: Beholde, where the Dreamer commeth, and counſayled togithers to kyll him, but Ruben (the eldeſt brother) woulde not conſent to that. Wherfore at his comming they ſtripped him out of his coate, and caſt him into an emptie pit. And as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Iſmaelites paſſed by, they ſolde Ioſeph to them for twentie pence of ſiluer, and tooke his Coate, and dipt it in Goates bloude, and had it home to their father, bearing him in hande they had founde it by the waye: Then Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob ſéeing his ſonnes coate, cryed out and rent his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſorrowe, thinking ſurely that wylde beaſtes had deuoured and torne Ioſeph in péeces: But he being <pb n="188" facs="tcp:12283:113"/> ſafe and ſound caried into Egipt, was there ſolde againe<note place="margin">39. cap.</note> to a certayne great Lorde of King Pharaos Court na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Putiphar: and became ſo lucky a man with him (by Gods prouidence) that his Mayſter made him chiefe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ouer all his houſe. And ſo continued in great fauour with his Lorde, vntill his Maiſters wyfe began to caſt hir loue vpon him, and woulde haue had him to lye with hir: Then Ioſeph to dyſſwade hys Myſtreſſe from hir inordinate loue, ſayde: Beholde, my Mayſter kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not what he hath in the houſe wyth mée, but hath committed all thynges hée hath into my handes.

How then can I doe this great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo ſinne againſt God? And thus he put hir of, and ſhunned hir companie (from that day foorth) aſmuch as he coulde poſſible doe. But one daye as Ioſeph ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the houſe to doe hys buſineſſe, and finding his Myſtreſſe there (by chaunce) alone, ſhe caught him by the cloake to haue him ſléepe with hir, which he denyed and woulde not conſent to hir minde, and when he ſawe hir ſo importune vpon him that he could not honeſtly part from hir, he wounde himſelfe out of his garment, and ſo depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Then ſhe called to hir men, declaring to them that Ioſeph woulde haue rauiſhed hir, and when I began to crie (quoth ſhe) he left his garment behinde him for haſte, and ranne awaye: which tale being tolde to Putiphar at his comming home, Ioſeph was caſt in priſon, where (by Gods prouiſion) he founde ſuch fauour with the kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that he committed all thinges vnder his hande to doe whatſoeuer he woulde.

Then the King perceyuing Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph to be a man endued with wiſedome and knowledge, made him Regent of his Realme, and called him the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of the worlde, for by his polityke prouiſion, Egipt was relieued in the harde and deare yeares, and the King greatly enriched. At this time was Ioſeph about the age of thirtie yeares, and tooke to wyfe, Aſnath the daughter of Putiphar Prieſt of On, and had by hir twoo ſonnes, Manaſſes and Ephraim. Nowe when the time of dearth was come, all landes being ſore oppreſſed with famine, ſent into Egipt for Corne, among the which, Iacob ſent ten of his ſonnes, who (at their comming before Ioſeph<note place="margin">42. cap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Then Ioſeph remembring his dreames, ſpake roughly to them, &amp; ſayde, they were ſpyes. Nay my Lord (quoth they) we are all one mans ſonnes and meane truely.

And when Ioſeph came in and ſaw all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, he demaunded, ſaying: Is your Father the olde man of whome yée tolde mée, in good health and yet aliue: Yea (quoth they) thy ſeruaunt is in good health and mery: And is this your yongeſt brother, of whom yée tolde mée? God be mercifull vnto thée my ſonne (quoth he) and with that his heart began ſo to melt, that he haſted into his Chamber and wept. And comming foorth againe with a cherefull countenaunce, he went to dinner with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, commaunding ech one to be ſet downe in order ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ages, whereat his brethren (within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues) marueyled. And during the time of refection, he rewarded euery one from his meſſe, but moſt of all Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamin. And when he had thus feaſted his brethren, ſo long<note place="margin">44. cap.</note> as pleaſed him, the night before their departing, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded their ſackes to be filled with Corne, and euerye mans money put into his ſackes mouth as before, and his ſiluer cup into Beniamins ſacke. And in the morning, as they were departed a little out of the Citie, a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ouertooke them, ſaying: Wherefore haue ye rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded euill for good: Is not that the cuppe, in the which my Lorde drincketh? and in the which he doth Prophecie?

The men hearing this <pb n="191" facs="tcp:12283:114"/> were marueylouſly aſtonyed, denying vtterlye that they neuer thought no ſuch déede againſt their Lord: but when their ſackes were ſearched, and the Cup founde.

And nowe when the men had made the beſt excuſe they coulde make, Ioſeph could no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayne,<note place="margin">Gen.

With that they were ſo aſtonyed with his preſence, that they coulde not aunſwere hym one woorde: I am Ioſeph your brother (quoth he) whome yée ſolde into Egipt, nowe therefore be not grieued with your ſelues that yée ſolde mée hither, for God dyd ſende mée before you for your preſeruation, for this is the ſeconde yeare of dearth, and fiue more are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, wherefore God ſent me before you, to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion for you in this lande, and to ſaue your lyues by a great deliueraunce: So nowe it was not you that ſent me hither but God, who hath made mée a Father vnto Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao, and Lorde of all his houſe, and ruler thorowout all the land of Egipt. Therefore now go and tell my father, and bid him come with all his houſhold to mée, and I will make prouiſion for him.

Which being done, ſhe caſt of hir mourning garments, &amp; decked hir ſelfe moſt brauelye, to allure the eyes of all men that ſhoulde beholde hir, which ſhe dyd not for anye voluptuouſneſſe or pleaſure of the fleſhe, but of a right diſcrecion and vertue: And ſo going foorth of hir houſe with Abra hir Mayde, ſhe came to the gate of the Citie, where the Elders ſtoode wayting hir <pb n="203" facs="tcp:12283:121"/> comming: And as they behelde hir woonderfull bewtie, which God at that preſent had giuen hir, they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylouſly aſtoniſhed. She then commaunding the gates to be open, tooke hir leaue of the people, who moſt hartily beſought the Lorde to be hir defence, &amp; well to performe the deuiſe of hir heart, that they might ſafely and ioyfully receyue hir preſence agayne: And ſo (committing hir to God) ſhut the gates, and looked ouer the walles after hir, ſo long as they could ſée hir. And as ſhe was going downe the mountaynes, the firſt watch of the Aſſirians tooke hir, demaunding what ſhe was, and whither ſhe went. I am (quoth ſhe) a daughter of the Hebrues, and am fled from them, bycauſe I knowe that they ſhall be giuen vnto you to be ſpoyled: Wherefore I am going to the Prince Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lofernes to tell him all theyr ſecretes, and howe he ſhall winne the Citie without the loſſe of one man. And when the men had pondered hir wordes and conſidered well hir bewtie, they put hir in good comfort of hir lyfe, &amp; brought hir to Holofernes, whoſe Maieſtie ſo abaſhed Iudith, that ſhe fell downe as one almoſt dead for feare. But being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyued agayne, Holofernes demaunded the cauſe of hir comming, to whom ſhe made aunſwere on this wiſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: O my Lord, if thou wilt receyue the wordes of thine handmayden, and doe thereafter, the Lorde ſhall bring thy matter, to a proſperous effect. For as thy ſeruaunt Achior gaue counſell vnto my Lord, to make ſearch whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had ſinned agaynſt their God or no: It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and plaine that their God is ſo wrath with them for their ſinnes, that he hath ſhewed by his Prophetes, that he will giue them ouer into the enimies hande. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſore afrayde, and ſuffer great hunger, and at this preſent (for lacke of water) are in a manner as dead menne, and in this extremitie brought, to kill theyr cattell and drincke the bloude: And alſo purpoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all the Wheate, Wyne and Oyle, which are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and ſanctified for the Prieſts, and not lawfull for the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:12283:122"/> people to touch. Wherefore I thy handmaide knowing all this, am fled from their preſence, for God hath ſent mée to woorke a thing wyth thée, that all the earth ſhall woonder, for thy ſeruaunt feareth the Lorde, and woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeth the God of heauen day and night: And nowe let me remayne with thée my Lorde, and let thy ſeruaunt go out in the night to the valley, and I will praye vnto God that he may reueale vnto mée, when they ſhall committe their ſinnes, that I may ſhewe them vnto thée, and than mayeſt thou ſurely go foorth with thine armie, for no man ſhall reſiſt thée, &amp; I will bring thée to Ieruſalem in ſuch ſafetie, that there ſhall not ſo much as one dogge barcke againſt thée. Nowe was Holofernes ſo well pleaſed with the wordes of this woman, and ſo farre in loue with hir bewtie, that he commaunded hir lodging to be made in the Tent where his treaſure laye, and to prepare hir diet of the ſame, that he himſelfe dyd eate and drincke of, but notwithſtanding ſhe tolde the King, that ſhe might not eate of his meate, leaſt ſhe ſhould offende hir God, but I can ſatiſfie my ſelfe (quoth ſhe) with ſuch thinges as I haue brought. Then how ſhall we doe (quoth Holofernes) if theſe thinges that thou haſt brought doe ſayle: where ſhall we haue the like to giue thée. As truely as the ſoule of my Lorde liueth (quoth ſhe) thine handmayde ſhall not ſpende all that I haue, tyll God haue brought to paſſe in my hande, the thing that I haue determined. And ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing licenſed to go out and in euery night at hir pleaſure to praye, ſhe went thrée nightes togither into the valley of Bethulia, calling vpon God to proſper hir deuiſe, for the deliueraunce of his people, and at eche time returned to hir Tent againe. And vppon the fourth daye as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Holofernes (by Gods prouidence) to make a great Banket vnto his Lordes, he ſent Vago his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layne to Iudith, to counſell hir to come and kéepe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye with hym that night for it were a ſhame for vs (quoth he) if we ſhoulde let ſuch a woman alone and not <pb n="205" facs="tcp:12283:122"/> talke with hir, we will allure hir, leaſt ſhe doe mocke vs. And when the meſſenger had done his meſſage, &amp; brought Iudith to Holofernes, his ſpirite (by and by) was mooued and rauiſhed with hir bewtie: Sit downe now (quoth he) and drincke with vs and be mery: I will drincke nowe my Lorde (quoth ſhe) and reioyce, bycauſe my ſtate is exalted more than euer it was before. And ſo ſhe eate and drancke before him, of ſuch things as hir Mayde had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, then Holofernes reioyced ſo much in Iudith, that he dranke more wyne at that time, than euer he had done in one daye before. Nowe when the euening was come, and euery man departed and gone to their lodging: Vago the Kinges Chamberlayne, ſhut the chamber doore and went his waye to bedde, leauing none but Iudith in the chamber with Holofernes, for hir Mayde was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſtande without the Chamber doore, to wayte hir Miſtreſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming foorth to pray. And as Holofernes laye ſtretched along vpon his bed ouercome with Wyne, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith ſtoode by his beddes ſyde and prayed on this wiſe: O Lorde God of all power, ſtrengthen me, and haue reſpect vnto the workes of my handes in this houre, that thou mayſt ſet vp thy citie of Ieruſalem, like as thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: O graunt, that by thée I may performe the thing which I haue deuiſed, and ſo tooke downe his ſwoorde, and holding him faſt by the heaire of his head, ſayde: Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then mée, O Lorde God of Iſrael, in this houre, and with that ſmote off his head, and rolled the deade bodye aſyde, and got hir foorth to hir mayde, and put the headde in hir Wallet, &amp; went foorth togithers, as though they had gone (as their cuſtome was) to praye. And ſo paſſing by the hoſte, and comming nyghe to the Citie of Bethulia, ſhe called to the watchmen to open the gate, for God is with vs (quoth ſhe) and hath ſhewed his power in Iſrael. And when the gates were ſet open, the people receyued hir (yoong and olde) with ſuch ioye as neuer the lyke was ſéene. Then ſayde Iudith: Oh prayſe yée the Lorde, and <pb n="206" facs="tcp:12283:123"/> giue thankes vnto our God, which hath not taken away his mercy from the houſe of Iſrael, but hath deſtroyed our enimies this night by my hande: And beholde here his head, whome the Lorde hath ſlayne by mée his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and returned his handmayde without any reproche of vylanie, wherefore giue praiſe and thanks to our God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe mercye endureth for euer. Nowe take the head, and hange it vpon the hyeſt place of your walles, and in the morning when the Sunne appeareth, go foorth with your weapons like valiaunt men, and make as though yée woulde ſet vpon your enimies, who will then prepare them to Armour: But when they ſhall go to rayſe vp their Captayne and finde hym without a heade, there will ſuch a fearefulneſſe fall vpon them, that euery man will ſéeke to ſaue himſelfe by flying, then doe yée followe them without all care, for God hath deliuered them into your handes. And ſo the Iſraelites followed the Aſſirians (which kept no order) and ſiue them downe right. And when they had ſlayne all their enimies, and gathered vp the ſpoyle, they gaue the Tent of Holofernes, and all that belonged to hym, vnto Iudith, by whome God had ſo mightyly wrought their deliueraunce, &amp; had hir in great honour, all the dayes of hir lyfe, who at the age of an hundred and fiue yeares dyed, and was moſt honorably buryed in Bethulia beſide hir huſbande.

And whyle he &amp; his ſonnes were thus mourning in Sackcloth, for the deſtruction of the holy Citie: Antiochus the King, ſent certayne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to the Citie of Modyn, to compell ſuch Iewes as were thither fled, to forſake their owne lawes, and to ſerue the Idols of the heathen. Who (after they had tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the heart of many) ſpake to Mathathias on this wiſe: Thou arte (ſayde they) a noble man of hye reputacion, and great in this Citie, and haſt many Children and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Come thou firſt of all and fulfill the Kinges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, lyke as the heathen haue done, and the men of Iuda, with ſuch as remayne at Ieruſalem, and ſo ſhalt thou and thy ſonnes be in fauour with the King and greatly enriched. Nay ſaid Mathathias: Though all Nations vnder the Kinges Dominion, fall away euerye man from the law of their fathers, yet will I, my ſonnes &amp; my brethren, walke in the lawes of our Fathers. God forbid we ſhoulde forſake the lawes and ordinaunces of God, we will not, for no mannes pleaſure, tranſgreſſe our religion, or breake the Statutes of our Lawe.

And by their force and ſtrength, they went about the coaſtes of Iſrael and deſtroyed the Aultars, &amp; circumciſed their children and kept their lawes in ſpite of all their beards. Finally, when the tyme of his death drewe nyghe, he called all his ſonnes before him, exhorting them to preferre the lawes and wealth of their Countrey, before their owne lyues, and ordayned Symon his eldeſt ſonne, to be as it were theyr Father, and Iudas Machabeus to be their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, and ſo giuing them his bleſſing he dyed, and was burned in his Fathers Sepulchre in the Citie of Modyn.

And when the time came that Iaſon ſhoulde pay the money to Antiochus, he ſent it by the hande of Menelaus, in whome he had great confidence. But when Menelaus was come to the King, he ſo craftily handled the matter with flatterie and fayre promiſes, that he both defrauded the King of his money, and Iaſon of his office: which, when he had obtained, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with an hye ſtomacke, more lyke a cruell tyrant, and the wrath of a wylde brute beaſt, than any thing that beſéemed a Prieſt.

And as they were going to the Citie of Lays, they came by the houſe of Micah: And being enformed by thoſe men, whome they had ſent before to ſpye out the lande, howe there was in the houſe of Micah, a grauen and a molten Image, they turned in thither, and ſaluted him peaceably, but at their departing they tooke hys I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols againſt the Leuites will, perſwading him, that it was not ſo good to be a Prieſt vnto the houſe of one man, as it was to be a Prieſt vnto a whole Tribe or kinred in Iſrael, and ſo tooke him away with them alſo. And being gone, Micah made a great outcrie, and followed after the children of Dan with all the power he coulde make, to reſcue his goddes: but being perſwaded to be content, and to get him home, leaſt a woorſe thing did happen, he then (perceyuing he was not able to make his partie good,) returned backe againe. Reade the Storie of Dan.

And hir twoo ſonnes (being maryed to twoo of the Moabitiſhe Damoſels) dyed there alſo. So that Naomy which had dwelt in the lande of Moab ten yeares, was left deſolate both of hir huſbande &amp; of hir ſonnes. Then Naomy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how the Lorde had viſited hir countrey agayne with plentie, retourned from Moab homewardes agayne, hir twoo daughters in lawe, bringing hir on the waye. And when ſhe ſaw they had gone a good way with hir, &amp; coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to retourne, ſhe ſayde vnto them: Go nowe my Daughters, and returne eche of you vnto your mothers houſe, and the Lorde deale as kindlye with you, as yée haue delt with the deadde and with mée. And the Lorde giue you, that yée maye finde reſt eyther of you, in the houſe of hir huſbande, and ſo kyſſed them, to haue bid them farewell: But when ſhe ſawe that they would not depart from hir, ſhe ſayde vnto them agayne: Returne my Daughters I praye you, for what cauſe will yée go with mée? Are there any mo children within my wombe to be your huſbands? Turne agayne therefore I ſay, for I am to olde to haue an huſbande. And if I dyd take one this night, and had all ready borne children, woulde yée tary

Then they wept all togithers, and Orpha kyſſed hir mother in lawe, and returned into hir owne lande agayne, but Ruth abode ſtill. And ſo when they came to Bethleem Iuda (which was about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Barley harneſt) the women which ſaw Nao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſayde: Is not this Naomy? Nay ſayde ſhe, call me not Naomy (which is as much to ſay, as bewtyfull) but call me Mara (that is to ſaye, bitter) for the Almightie God, hath made mée verye bitter. I went out full, and the Lorde hath brought mée agayne emptie, why then call yée mée Naomy, ſéeing the Lorde hath humbled mée, and the Almightie hath brought mée vnto aduerſitie? And ſo Naomy remayned in Bethleem Iuda, where (or it were long) God gaue hir a Sonne by the wombe of Ruth hir daughter in lawa, who was maryed to Boos, a kinſman of Naomyes, which Childe being borne, the women ſayde vnto Naomy: Bleſſed be the Lorde, the which hath not left thée without a kinſman to haue a name in Iſrael, and that ſhall bring thy lyfe agayne and cheriſhe thyne olde age, for thy daughter in lawe which loueth thée, hath borne vnto hym, and ſhe is better vnto thée than ſeuen ſonnes. And Naomy tooke the Childe and layed it in hir lap, and became nurſe vnto it, being glad that a ſonne was borne vnto hir, in hir olde dayes.

Ieſus: Verilye, verilye, I ſaye vnto thée, except a man be borne from aboue, he cannot ſée the kingdome of God.

The tenor of the Scripture which he readde, was this: He was ledde as a ſhéepe to be ſlayne, and like a Lambe dumbe before his ſhearer, ſo opened he not hys mouth. Bicauſe of his humbleneſſe, he was not eſtéemed: But who ſhall declare his generation, and his lyfe is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the earth. When Philip had repeated thys Text vnto the Chamberlaine, he ſayde vnto Philip: I <pb n="264" facs="tcp:12283:158"/> pray thée of whome ſpeaketh the Prophet this, of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or of ſome other man.

Sée, here is water, what doth let me to be baptiſed? Philip ſayde, if thou beléeue with all thy heart, thou mayeſt. And he ſayde: I beléeue that Ieſus Chriſt is the ſonne of God.

But hauing no aucthoritie to condemne or put hym to death, they brought hym bounde vnto Pylate the temporall Iudge. Saying, howe that they had founde him peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the people and forbidding trybute to Ceſar, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelfe a King. Pilate hearing this, demaunded of him, whither he were a King or no. Ieſus neyther deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor affirming that he was, made aunſwere that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late himſelfe had ſayde ſo. Then Pilate ſayde vnto all his accuſers, how that in examining of Ieſus, he coulde not ſée that he had offended in anye ſuch thing, as they had charged him withall. The people than, more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye affirmed, how that he had with his teaching and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching (which he firſt began in Galile) mooued all Iewry to follow his doctrine. When Pilate perceyued the man to be of Galile, and that his matter pertayned to Herods iuriſdiction, he ſent hym (foorthwith) to Herode lying at Ieruſalem. Who of a long tyme had béene deſirous to ſée hym. But when as Herode had demaunded many things of him, and coulde haue no aunſwere agayne, he diſpiſed and mocked hym, and ſo returned hym backe agayne to Pilate clothed all in<note n="*" place="margin">Commonly this was a robe of honor or excellencie, but it was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to chriſt in mockage.</note> white. And from that daye foorth, Pilate and Herode were euermore friendes, who before were enimies. Then Pilate (for ſo much as Herode had ſent Ieſus backe agayne, and done nothing vnto hym, and that neyther he nor Herode coulde finde anyething <pb n="266" facs="tcp:12283:159"/> in him woorthie of death) would haue chaſtyned Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and ſo let him go. But the hyghe Prieſtes layed ſo manye thinges agaynſt him, that Pilate (after he had reaſoned a little with Ieſus, concerning his Kingdome and other thinges) went and ſate in iudgement, knowing right well in his conſcience, that the Prieſtes of verye enuie had deliuered Ieſus vnto him. And being ſet downe vpon the iudgement ſeate, his wyfe ſent to hym, ſaying: Haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man, for I haue ſuffered manye thinges this daye in a dreame, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of hym. Which counſell of his wyfe, nor yet his owne knowledge, did any thing the more mooue him, to defende the innocencie of Chriſt, but aſked of the people, which of theſe twoo they woulde haue quitte, Barrabas or Ieſus, and they ſayde Barrabas. What ſhall I then doe (quoth he) with Ieſus which is called Chriſt? They all ſaide, let hym be Crucified. What euill or great offence hath hée done (quoth Pilate) that deſerueth death? The people being much more eager than they were before, cryed out amayne to haue him Crucified. When Pilate ſaw this, that he coulde not preuayle agaynſt them, he tooke water and waſhed his handes, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt perſon, in the which ſaying he bare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<note place="margin">Pilate mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the Galileans, as they were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing: and ſo their bloud was mingled with the blud of the beaſtes which were ſacrificed.</note> of his innocencie, before he condemned him. And ſo delyuering Ieſus to the Souldiours, they ſcourged him, and arayed him in purple, with a crowne of thorne vpon his heade. In which ſorte Pilate brought hym foorth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, and ſayde to the people: Beholde, I bring hym foorth to you, that yée may knowe that I finde no fault in him. And when Ieſus appeared before them, Pilate ſaid: Beholde the man, which he ſpake in mockerye, bicauſe that Chriſt had called him ſelfe a King. And when the hye Prieſtes and Officers ſawe hym, they cryed out, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifige, Crucifige. Then ſaide Pilate take him to you and Crucifie hym, for I can finde no cauſe of death in the man. They aunſwered agayne and ſayde: It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <pb n="267" facs="tcp:12283:159"/> for vs to put any man to death, but we haue a lawe, &amp; by our lawe he ought to dye, bycauſe he made hymſelfe the Sonne of God. When Pilate hearde this, he was afrayde, and went agayne into the iudgement Hall, and demaunded of Ieſus what he was, but he made hym no aunſwere. Then Pilate ſayde: Why ſpeakeſt thou not? Doeſt thou not ſée, that it lyeth in my handes, eyther to kyll or ſaue thée? To that he made aunſwere and ſayde: Thou couldeſt haue no power at all agaynſt mée, except it were giuen thée from aboue, therefore he that deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mée vnto thée, hath the more ſinne, &amp; from that tyme foorth Pilate ſought by all meanes to deliuer hym. But the Iewes cryed vppon hym, ſaying: If thou let him go thou arte not Ceſars friende, for whoſoeuer maketh himſelfe a King, ſpeaketh agaynſt Ceſar. When Pilate hearde them ſay ſo, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate him downe in the Iudgement ſeate, ſaying vnto the people: Beholde your King, they cryed, awaye with him, away with him, crucifie hym. What (quoth Pilate) ſhall I crucifye your King? To that the hyghe Prieſtes made aunſwere and ſayde: We haue no King but Ceſar.

And being twentie yeares without a Childe, at laſt ſhe conceyued with twoo: and when ſhe felt them ſtriue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hir wombe, ſhe made hir mone to God, ſaying: Sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo, why am I thus with childe. God made hir an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, ſaying: There are twoo maner of people in thy wombe, &amp; two Nacions ſhalbe deuided out of thy bowels: And the one Nacion ſhalbe mightier than the other: And the elder ſhalbe ſeruaunt to the yoonger. And ſo when hir tyme was come to be delyuered, ſhe brought foorth twoo twynnes, the one named Eſau, and the other Iacob. Which twoo became mightie men, but Rebecca looued Iacob better then Eſau: and to preferre hym before the other ſhe ſayde: Heare mée my ſonne Iacob, I haue hearde thy Father ſaye to thy brother, go and kyll ſome Veniſon, and make mée meate thereof, that I may eate and bleſſe thée, before the Lorde, afore I dye. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="275" facs="tcp:12283:163"/> my Sonne heare my voyce in that which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde thée: Get thée to the flocke, and bring mée thence two good kyddes, that I may make meate of them for thy father, ſuch as he loueth, and thou ſhalt bring it hym to eate, that he may bleſſe thée before his death. Then ſayde Iacob: My brother Eſau is a rough man, and if my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall happen to féele mée, I ſhall ſéeme vnto him, as I went about to deceyue him, and ſo ſhall I bring a curſe vpon mée, &amp; not a bleſſing. Well (ſayde Rebecca) vpon mée be thy curſſe my ſonne, onely heare my voyce, and go and fetche me them. And when he had brought the Kyddes, and that ſhe had dreſt the meate and made it readye, ſhe fette out certayne rayment of Eſaus, and put it vpon Iacob, and couered his hands and the ſmoothe of his necke with Goate ſhinnes, and put the meate in his hande to cary to his Father, by which policie of Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Iacob had his brothers bleſſing. And when ſhe heard how his brother threatned to kyll him for ſtealing awaye his bleſſing, ſhe tolde it Iacob, ſaying: Thy brother Eſau threatneth to ſley thée, therefore my ſome heare my voyce: Make thée ready, and get thée to Laban my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Haran: and tary with him a while vntill thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fierceneſſe be ſwaged, and that his wrath be turned awaye from thée, and he forget the thinges which thou haſt done vnto him, and then will I ſende and fet thée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye from thence, for why ſhoulde I be depryued of you both in one daye: And when ſhe had giuen hir ſonne this counſell, ſhe went to Iſaac hir huſbande and ſayde: I am weary of my lyfe, for feare of the daughters of Heth. If Iacob take a wyfe of the daughters of Heth, ſuch one as theſe are, or of the Daughters of the lande, what good ſhall my lyfe doe mée. And ſo by the counſell of Rebecca, Iacob was ſent to Laban his mothers brother, where in proceſſe he got him a wyfe, and purchaſed the loue of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau his brother agayne.

And ſo Samuel miniſtered vnto the Lorde before<note place="margin">3. cap.</note> Eli: And one daye as he layed him downe to ſléepe in the Temple, the Lorde called him: And Samuel (thinking <pb n="287" facs="tcp:12283:169"/> it had béene his Mayſter) ranne to Eli, to knowe his pleaſure, who ſayde he called him not. And at the thirde time when Samuel came to his mayſter agayne, Eli ſayde vnto him: Go and laye thée downe once more, and if he call thée agayne, then ſaye thou: Speake Lorde, for thy ſeruaunt heareth. And when the Lorde had called him the fourth time, and had opened vnto him, all that he had determined againſt the houſe of Eli (for not correcting his ſonnes for their great wickedneſſe) Samuel went to his mayſter Eli, and (at his commaundement) tolde him euery whit what the Lorde had ſayde. Now Samuel (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords Prophet) iudged the people, and was both loued &amp; feared of them. And when he began to waxe olde,<note place="margin">8. cap.</note> and was not able to beare the burden, he made his twoo ſonnes (Ioel and Abia) Iudges ouer Iſrael, thinking that they woulde imitate his ſteppes: But contrarywiſe, they were ſo couetous, that (for lucre ſake) they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted all true iuſtice: wherevpon the Elders of Iſrael, perceyuing Samuel to be olde, and his ſonnes giuen all to coueteouſneſſe, went to Samuel, deſiring of him that they might haue a king to raygne ouer them as other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had.

For the Lorde hath ſought him out a man, after his owne heart, which ſhall rule the people, and ſo Samuel departed to his houſe at Gibea. After this, when<note place="margin">15. cap.</note> Saule had broken the Lordes commaundement, in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Agag King of the Amalachites alyue, and had made a ſacrifice vnto the Lorde of their beſt ſhéepe and Cattell which hée reſerued: Samuel came, whereof the Kinge was verye glad, and tolde hym that he had fulfilled the Lordes commaundement: But what meaneth then (quoth Samuel) the bleting of the ſhéepe and noyſe of Oxen that I heare? There are (quoth he) the beſt ſhéepe and Oxen that the people hath ſpared to ſacrifice vnto the Lorde, but the reaſt haue we deſtroyed. Then ſayde Samuel: Did not the Lord when thou wert little in thine olvne eyes, make thée King ouer Iſrael, and gaue thée a charge, vtterly to deſtroy thoſe ſinners the Amalachites? And wherefore haſt thou obeyed the people and not the Lorde?

For why: our God whome we ſerue is able to kéepe vs from the whote bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Ouen, (O King) and can right well delyuer vs out of thy hands: And though he will not, yet ſhalt thou know (O King) that we will not ſerue thy goddes, nor doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to that Image which thou haſt ſet vp. The King hearing this, was ſo full of indignacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he cauſed the ſtrongeſt men that were in all his hoſt, to bind them hand and foote, and caſt them into the Ouen, which Ouen was made ſo exceding hote, that the flame of the fire deſtroyed thoſe men that caſt them in. And as the King looked into the Ouen after the men, he ſawe fower walking at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the middeſt of the Ouen, and the fourth man was lyke vnto the ſonne of God to looke vpon. And being ſore aſtonyed thereat, he went to the Ouens mouth and ſaide: O yée ſeruauntes of God, come out of the Ouen. And when they were come foorth, it coulde not be perceyued, neyther by the heaire of their heades, neyther yet by the ſmell of their garments, that euer any fyre had touched them. And ſo the King prayſed the God of Sidrach, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſach and Abednago, and promoted them to honour.</p>

It is better for mée to fall into your handes without the déede dooing, than to ſinne in the ſight of the Lorde, and with that cryed out with a lowde voyce, and the Elders cryed out agaynſt hir, which clamour on both parties was ſo great, that it was hearde among the Seruauntes without, which ranne to the Orcharde doore and burſt it open, to ſée what the matter was: And when the ſeruaunts, had heard the Elders report of Suſanna, they were greatly aſhamed, for there was neuer ſuch a reporte made of Suſanna be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

And after the Kings death, being ſlayne of hys owne ſonnes within .xlv. dayes after, Toby returned, and was reſtored to his goodes agayne, and called his kinred and friendes togither, and made a great feaſt. And ſitting at the Table with his gueſtes, one tolde him there lay an Iſraelite ſlayne in the ſtréete, who then immediatly lept from the boorde, and went faſting to the deade corſe, and brought him home to his houſe, where he hidde him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily vntill the Sunne was downe, and then buryed hym. For the which déede his friendes reprooued him, bicauſe he had bene in daunger but a little before, euen for the lyke matter. But neuertheleſſe, Tobias (fearing God more than the King) woulde take the ſlayne, and hyde them in his houſe, and bnrie them at midnight. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that one tyme he was ſo weary with burying the deade, that he got him home, and layde him downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide a wall for wearyneſſe, where he fell on ſléepe: And ſo lying, there fell downe vpon his eyes, warme dung out of a ſwalowes neſt, which tooke awaye his ſight, that he coulde not ſée, agaynſt the which plague of blindneſſe he neuer grudged, but remayned ſteadfaſt in the feare of God, giuing him thankes as well for that, as other gifts of health. And this temptacion God ſuffered to fall on Toby, for an example of pacience to all that ſhould come after. Finally, of his great pacience, déede of charitie, and other godlye exhortacions, his booke is full. He loſt his<note place="margin">Tob. 14. a.</note> ſight at the age of ſixe and fiftie yeares. And was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at thrée ſcore ſo that he remayned blind about a foure yeare.

And when he had got the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of the yoong King, he conceyued treaſon agaynſt hym, which he thought coulde neuer be well brought to paſſe, ſo long as Ionathas (whome the King had made hygh Prieſt) was his friende, wherefore he ſought to kill Ionathas, that he might come the eaſyer by his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked purpoſe. So Triphon went to a place called Bethſan<note place="margin">12. c. cap.</note> at the which place Ionathas met hym with fourtie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande men. Then Triphon perceyuing the great hoſte that Ionathas brought, was afrayde, and thought it not beſt to meddle with him at that time, but to vſe ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie howe to betraye hym.

And when he had knowledge that Symon ſtoode vp in the ſteade of his brother Ionathas, and that he woulde come agaynſt him, he ſent worde to Symon, that where as he kept Ionathas his brother in warde, it was but for mony he ought in the Kings account, and other buſineſſe he had in hande. Therefore if he woulde ſende hym an hundred Talents of Siluer, and the twoo ſonnes of Ionathas to be their fathers ſuretie, he would ſende him home againe: But Symon knewe his diſſembling heart well ynough. Yet neuertheleſſe (leaſt he ſhould be a greater enimie to the people of Iſrael, and ſay an other daye, that bycauſe he ſent him not the money and the children, therefore is Ionathas dead) he ſent him both the money and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
